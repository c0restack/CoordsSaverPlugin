# CoordsSaverPlugin
A minecraft server plugin that lets players save and later check location coords.

Players can add tags to specify a location. All players on the server can see saved coords which makes sharing locations easier.
Like my other plugins I just made this to work on my rapberry pi. If you want to use this as well shoot me a message and I'll update it to be more universal.
